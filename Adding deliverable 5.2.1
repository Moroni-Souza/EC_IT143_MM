-- A1: According to the information provided by our companies records we cannot know what are the demands and
--services, but we do know where we were receiveing more income per employees, based on those information
--we can conclude that companies located in the countries: Ghana, Philippines, Ecuador, Hungary, Moldova, Turkey
--Greece, Honduras, Malta, Thailand have less revenue due to lack of material, we
--have plans to purchase new material within the established period of 2 years for the smallest companies which
--are 23 counted so far, this approach is because we notice all did not got great incomes in the last 4 years,
--a cost balance will be made along with a plan so that expenses can be divided in monthly payments according
--to our company finantial conditions.

--and find the real or approximate reason for these results.
